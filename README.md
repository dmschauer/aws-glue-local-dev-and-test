# What does it do?

This repository helps you to setup a local development environment for AWS Glue PySpark jobs.
It works for both Windows and Ubuntu/Mac OS.

It contains:
- a template for an AWS Glue PySpark job
- a template for a corresponding pytest unit test

For more details, please read the article. It explains step by step what to do to start developing on your local machine (i.e. without AWS Glue charges!).
